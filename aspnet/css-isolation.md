### CSS isolation

To avoid large global css files and styling conflicts CSS isolation has been introduced in .NET 6. To add scoped css for a View add a file called [view-name].cshtml.css to your project. This file will contain the styling for the specific view. The css for each View will be bundled in a static asset file with the naming [project-name].styles.css.
