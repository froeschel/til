# Inversion of Control

Inversion of control is a principal where the dependency of an object are handed to the object when it is created. This way there is no tight coupling between the object and the dependency. We can see with unit testing where we inject mock objects into the test code. Another example of this principle is the dependency injection used in ASP.NET Core.
