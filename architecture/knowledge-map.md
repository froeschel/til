Here is an example of a knowledge map for software architecture based on [ByteByteGo]("https://bytebytego.com/").

1) Master a Programming Language
    * Look to master 1-2 programming languages such as Java, Python, Golang, JavaScript, etc.

2) Tools
    * Build proficiency with key tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Jira, ELK, Sonar, etc.

3) Design Principles

5) Platform Knowledge
    * Get to know about several platforms such as containers, orchestration, cloud, serverless, CDN, API Gateways, Distributed Systems, and CI/CD

6) Data Analytics
    * Build a solid knowledge of data and analytics components like SQL and NoSQL databases, data streaming solutions with Kafka, object storage, data migration, OLAP, and so on.

7) Networking and Security
    * Learn about networking and security concepts such as DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTPS, Encryption, JWT, OAuth, and Credential Management.
