# Spec-Driven Development

Spec-driven development as the name states, starts with writing the specifications for the software you want to build. The specification then becomes the contract on how the software should work. This approach can be used when developing with AI agents. 
The specification gives the agents a clear input on which functionality to implement. The specification can also be used to create tests in order to verify that the agents have developed the software correctly.
