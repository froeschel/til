# What is Azure CDN?

Azure CDN is a content delivery netwoek (CDN), which serves cached content close to the user. 
Cached content could be images, videos or static files like css libraries. In our case we use it to serve fonts and css to our
webapp instances. This way we make sure we can load our assets really fast and there is one place where we can manage static 
content for the sites.
