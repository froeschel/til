# HTTP Error 500.30 - ASP.NET Core app failed to start

It can happen that an Azure Function throws an 500.30 error without any changes being deployed. The only way to recover from this issue was to stop the function (not restarting) and then starting it up again. The function will find a new computing host and the issue will be resolved.
