# HNSW

Hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) is a powerful algorithm used in computer science and information retrieval systems to efficiently search large datasets. It addresses the challenge of finding the nearest neighbors of a given data point in a high-dimensional space by organizing the data in a vector database.

## When to use
- Large-scale low-latency vector search (semantic search, recommendations).
- Not recommended when exact nearest neighbors are strictly required.
