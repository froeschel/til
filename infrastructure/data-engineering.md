Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for the aggregation, storage and analysis of data at scale. Data engineers empower organizations to get insights in real time from large datasets.

There are different use cases for data engineering. Here are some examples:

 - Data collection and management: Develop a standard way of collecting and storing data and make them ready for consumption.
 - Real time data analysis: Push data to an analysis engine for real time insights.
 - Machine learning: Prepare data for training matierial.
