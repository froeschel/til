# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open spurce data streaming platform for building data piplines. 
A use case where Kafka can be useful is real time processing. An event producer can deliver an event to a Kafka topic where it is persisted on disk. Another application can then consume events from the topic. Kafka garantuees that the events are in order. This way it is possible to update analytics stores or ML models in realtime.
