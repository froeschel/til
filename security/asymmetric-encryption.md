# Asymmetric encryption
For asymmetric encryption there are two keys. A private and a public key. The public key can be used to encrypt data and the private key will be able to decrypt the data. The two keys will be generated by key generation algorithm. With asymmetric encryption one can encrypt data at rest or in transit. Examples of asymmetric encryption are TSL and digital signatures.
